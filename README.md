**Turkey Vulture Movement vs. Surface Temperature (Â°C)**

Python code used to create this animation (https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/zb8e6k/turkey_vulture_movement_vs_surface_temperature_c/) detailing the migration of three North American turkey vultures. Python code pulls data from Movebank.org and NASA Earth Oberservation and generates an individual map for every day showing the location of each turkey vulture and the global surface temperature using Matplotlib, Pandas, and Sklearn. Blender used to compress all maps together and produce animation.
